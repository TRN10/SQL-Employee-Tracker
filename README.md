# SQL-Employee-Tracker
## Coding boot camp week 12 challenge

This is a Content Management System that allows an employer to access, store and update information about their employees in an sql database. The results of the user's actions are displayed in the terminal. The application is initialised by typing 'node index.js' in the command line. The user is then presented with a selection of options, the list of options can then be navigated by using the up/down arrows and then selected by pressing 'enter'. After each selected option is complete the user is presented with the same set of options to perform further actions or is able to exit the application by selecting the 'exit' option. This challenge introduces SQL to create the database which stores the user's information. Unfortunately this application is incomplete and does not perform all of the specified functionality listed in the challenge's acceptance criteria. The biggest challenge for me was trying to figure out how to query the database and be able to use the results to dynamically create an inquirer prompt that would allow the user to select, for example, a list of exisitng departments in which a newly created role would exist. The option to add an employee is functional but does not present the user with a list of managers to select from, the option to add a role and to update an employee role are not functional. 

### Installation

The user is required to type 'npm install' in the command line to install requried node modules. The application is then initialised in the terminal by the command 'node index.js'.
